# Santiago Morales - Junior Software Engineer

Hello, this is my full stack portfolio website for web development. It uses `VueJs`, `Firebase` and other libraries.

## My process

I started planning the design of the website - each page until I knew how the whole website would look like. I created wireframes with pen and paper, prototyping the website and its animations of HTML elements.

## Tools used

- Vue Router
- Pinia
- Firebase `npm install firebase`
- Firestore `npm install firebase@10.7.0 --save`
- Sass `npm install -D sass`
