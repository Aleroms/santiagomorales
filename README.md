# Santiago Morales - Junior Software Engineer

Hello, this is my full stack portfolio website for web development. It uses `VueJs`, `Firebase` and other libraries.

## My process

I started planning the design of the website - each page until I knew how the whole website would look like. I created wireframes with pen and paper, prototyping the website and its animations of HTML elements.

## Tools used

- Vue Router `npm install vue-router@4`
- Pinia `npm install pinia`
- Firebase `npm install firebase`
- Firestore `npm install firebase@10.7.0 --save`
- Sass `npm install -D sass`
- VueUse `npm install @vueuse/core`
- Fontawesome

```shell
npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
npm i --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
npm i --save @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons
npm i --save @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons
npm i --save @fortawesome/vue-fontawesome@latest-3
```

- VeeValidate `npm i vee-validate --save`

## Issues Encountered

An issue I encountered had to deal with the navbar. I was trying to make it have a slide down on scroll effect, which worked but my navbar was overflowing on the x. I fixed this by using `box-sizing: border-box;` on my nav container class. This now used the padding and border to calculate the width.
